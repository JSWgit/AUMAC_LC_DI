## Content of the repository

This repository provides code to evaluate random-coding bounds on the per-user probability of error (PUPE) of asynchronous unsourced multiple-access channels (AUMACs). 

1. AUMAC_with_latency_constraint.py provides the upper bound on the PUPE for Theorem 2 in [1].
2. AUMAC_Wrap_Decoding.py provides the upper bound on the PUPE for Theorems 5 and 6 in [1].
3. Corollary.py provides the upper bound on the PUPE for Corollary in [1].
4. AUMAC_Converse.m provides the converse bounds in [1].
5. /SDA/: cyclic\_decoding\_1.m computes the upper bound on the PUPE in [3] corresponding to the first term in Remark 1 of [1] and [3]. cyclic\_decoding\_2.m then computes the full upper bound in [3], using the first-term contribution obtained from cyclic\_decoding\_1.m.
6. Polyanskiy.py provides the upper bound on the PUPE in [4] Y. Polyanskiy, "A perspective on massive random-access," in Proc. IEEE Int. Symp. Inf. Theory (ISIT), 2017, Aachen, Germany, pp. 2523-2527.
7. CCS_AMP_BP_AUMAC.py provides the upper bound on the PUPE by the CCS-AMP-BP scheme, which was originally proposed in [6]. We extend this scheme to the AUMAC system.

**Note**: The Eb/N0 of the CCS-AMP-BP scheme for the UMAC is copied from [6], and hence not included in this repository. 

**Note**: The above files do not evaluate the probability of message collisions or power-constraint violations. The probability of message collisions can be approximated by \frac{K_a (K_a - 1)}{2M}. The probability of power-constraint violations can be derived using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the chi-square distribution.

**Version**: The simulations are performed with Python 3.13.4 and pytorch 2.7.1.
